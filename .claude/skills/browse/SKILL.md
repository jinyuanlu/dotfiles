  Fast headless browser for QA testing and site dogfooding. Navigate any URL, interact with
  elements, verify page state, diff before/after actions, take annotated screenshots, check
  responsive layouts, test forms and uploads, handle dialogs, and assert element states.
  ~100ms per command. Use when you need to test a feature, verify a deployment, dogfood a
  user flow, or file a bug with evidence. Use when asked to "open in browser", "test the
  site", "take a screenshot", or "dogfood this".
allowed-tools:
  - Bash
  - Read
  - AskUserQuestion

## Preamble (run first)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gstack/sessions
touch ~/.gstack/sessions/"$PPID"
_SESSIONS=$(find ~/.gstack/sessions -mmin -120 -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
find ~/.gstack/sessions -mmin +120 -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
_PROACTIVE=$(~/.claude/skills/bin/config get proactive 2>/dev/null || echo "true")
_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"
echo "PROACTIVE: $_PROACTIVE"
mkdir -p ~/.gstack/analytics
echo '{"skill":"browse","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","repo":"'$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")'"}'  >> ~/.gstack/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not proactively suggest gstack skills — only invoke
them when the user explicitly asks. The user opted out of proactive suggestions.


## AskUserQuestion Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every AskUserQuestion call:**
1. **Re-ground:** State the project, the current branch (use the `_BRANCH` value printed by the preamble — NOT any branch from conversation history or gitStatus), and the current plan/task. (1-2 sentences)
2. **Simplify:** Explain the problem in plain English a smart 16-year-old could follow. No raw function names, no internal jargon, no implementation details. Use concrete examples and analogies. Say what it DOES, not what it's called.
3. **Recommend:** `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]` — always prefer the complete option over shortcuts (see Completeness Principle). Include `Completeness: X/10` for each option. Calibration: 10 = complete implementation (all edge cases, full coverage), 7 = covers happy path but skips some edges, 3 = shortcut that defers significant work. If both options are 8+, pick the higher; if one is ≤5, flag it.
4. **Options:** Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...` — when an option involves effort, show both scales: `(human: ~X / CC: ~Y)`

Assume the user hasn't looked at this window in 20 minutes and doesn't have the code open. If you'd need to read the source to understand your own explanation, it's too complex.

Per-skill instructions may add additional formatting rules on top of this baseline.

## Completeness Principle — Boil the Lake

AI-assisted coding makes the marginal cost of completeness near-zero. When you present options:

- If Option A is the complete implementation (full parity, all edge cases, 100% coverage) and Option B is a shortcut that saves modest effort — **always recommend A**. The delta between 80 lines and 150 lines is meaningless with CC+gstack. "Good enough" is the wrong instinct when "complete" costs minutes more.
- **Lake vs. ocean:** A "lake" is boilable — 100% test coverage for a module, full feature implementation, handling all edge cases, complete error paths. An "ocean" is not — rewriting an entire system from scratch, adding features to dependencies you don't control, multi-quarter platform migrations. Recommend boiling lakes. Flag oceans as out of scope.
- **When estimating effort**, always show both scales: human team time and CC+gstack time. The compression ratio varies by task type — use this reference:

| Task type | Human team | CC+gstack | Compression |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Boilerplate / scaffolding | 2 days | 15 min | ~100x |
| Test writing | 1 day | 15 min | ~50x |
| Feature implementation | 1 week | 30 min | ~30x |
| Bug fix + regression test | 4 hours | 15 min | ~20x |
| Architecture / design | 2 days | 4 hours | ~5x |
| Research / exploration | 1 day | 3 hours | ~3x |

- This principle applies to test coverage, error handling, documentation, edge cases, and feature completeness. Don't skip the last 10% to "save time" — with AI, that 10% costs seconds.

**Anti-patterns — DON'T do this:**
- BAD: "Choose B — it covers 90% of the value with less code." (If A is only 70 lines more, choose A.)
- BAD: "We can skip edge case handling to save time." (Edge case handling costs minutes with CC.)
- BAD: "Let's defer test coverage to a follow-up PR." (Tests are the cheapest lake to boil.)
- BAD: Quoting only human-team effort: "This would take 2 weeks." (Say: "2 weeks human / ~1 hour CC.")

## Steps to reproduce
1. {step}

## Raw output
```
{paste the actual error or unexpected output here}
```

## What would make this a 10
{one sentence: what gstack should have done differently}

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {gstack version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```

Slug: lowercase, hyphens, max 60 chars (e.g. `browse-js-no-await`). Skip if file already exists. Max 3 reports per session. File inline and continue — don't stop the workflow. Tell user: "Filed gstack field report: {title}"

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

# browse: QA Testing & Dogfooding

Persistent headless Chromium. First call auto-starts (~3s), then ~100ms per command.
State persists between calls (cookies, tabs, login sessions).

## SETUP (run this check BEFORE any browse command)

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
B=""
[ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.claude/skills/browse/dist/browse" ] && B="$_ROOT/.claude/skills/browse/dist/browse"
[ -z "$B" ] && B=~/.claude/skills/browse/dist/browse
if [ -x "$B" ]; then
  echo "READY: $B"
else
  echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
fi
```

If `NEEDS_SETUP`:
1. Tell the user: "gstack browse needs a one-time build (~10 seconds). OK to proceed?" Then STOP and wait.
2. Run: `cd <SKILL_DIR> && ./setup`
3. If `bun` is not installed: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`

## Core QA Patterns

### 1. Verify a page loads correctly
```bash
$B goto https://yourapp.com
$B text                          # content loads?
$B console                       # JS errors?
$B network                       # failed requests?
$B is visible ".main-content"    # key elements present?
```

### 2. Test a user flow
```bash
$B goto https://app.com/login
$B snapshot -i                   # see all interactive elements
$B fill @e3 "user@test.com"
$B fill @e4 "password"
$B click @e5                     # submit
$B snapshot -D                   # diff: what changed after submit?
$B is visible ".dashboard"       # success state present?
```

### 3. Verify an action worked
```bash
$B snapshot                      # baseline
$B click @e3                     # do something
$B snapshot -D                   # unified diff shows exactly what changed
```

### 4. Visual evidence for bug reports
```bash
$B snapshot -i -a -o /tmp/annotated.png   # labeled screenshot
$B screenshot /tmp/bug.png                # plain screenshot
$B console                                # error log
```

### 5. Find all clickable elements (including non-ARIA)
```bash
$B snapshot -C                   # finds divs with cursor:pointer, onclick, tabindex
$B click @c1                     # interact with them
```

### 6. Assert element states
```bash
$B is visible ".modal"
$B is enabled "#submit-btn"
$B is disabled "#submit-btn"
$B is checked "#agree-checkbox"
$B is editable "#name-field"
$B is focused "#search-input"
$B js "document.body.textContent.includes('Success')"
```

### 7. Test responsive layouts
```bash
$B responsive /tmp/layout        # mobile + tablet + desktop screenshots
$B viewport 375x812              # or set specific viewport
$B screenshot /tmp/mobile.png
```

### 8. Test file uploads
```bash
$B upload "#file-input" /path/to/file.pdf
$B is visible ".upload-success"
```

### 9. Test dialogs
```bash
$B dialog-accept "yes"           # set up handler
$B click "#delete-button"        # trigger dialog
$B dialog                        # see what appeared
$B snapshot -D                   # verify deletion happened
```

### 10. Compare environments
```bash
$B diff https://staging.app.com https://prod.app.com
```

### 11. Show screenshots to the user
After `$B screenshot`, `$B snapshot -a -o`, or `$B responsive`, always use the Read tool on the output PNG(s) so the user can see them. Without this, screenshots are invisible.

## User Handoff

When you hit something you can't handle in headless mode (CAPTCHA, complex auth, multi-factor
login), hand off to the user:

```bash
# 1. Open a visible Chrome at the current page
$B handoff "Stuck on CAPTCHA at login page"

# 2. Tell the user what happened (via AskUserQuestion)
#    "I've opened Chrome at the login page. Please solve the CAPTCHA
#     and let me know when you're done."

# 3. When user says "done", re-snapshot and continue
$B resume
```

**When to use handoff:**
- CAPTCHAs or bot detection
- Multi-factor authentication (SMS, authenticator app)
- OAuth flows that require user interaction
- Complex interactions the AI can't handle after 3 attempts

The browser preserves all state (cookies, localStorage, tabs) across the handoff.
After `resume`, you get a fresh snapshot of wherever the user left off.

## Snapshot Flags

The snapshot is your primary tool for understanding and interacting with pages.

```
-i        --interactive           Interactive elements only (buttons, links, inputs) with @e refs
-c        --compact               Compact (no empty structural nodes)
-d <N>    --depth                 Limit tree depth (0 = root only, default: unlimited)
-s <sel>  --selector              Scope to CSS selector
-D        --diff                  Unified diff against previous snapshot (first call stores baseline)
-a        --annotate              Annotated screenshot with red overlay boxes and ref labels
-o <path> --output                Output path for annotated screenshot (default: /tmp/browse-annotated.png)
-C        --cursor-interactive    Cursor-interactive elements (@c refs — divs with pointer, onclick)
```

All flags can be combined freely. `-o` only applies when `-a` is also used.
Example: `$B snapshot -i -a -C -o /tmp/annotated.png`

**Ref numbering:** @e refs are assigned sequentially (@e1, @e2, ...) in tree order.
@c refs from `-C` are numbered separately (@c1, @c2, ...).

After snapshot, use @refs as selectors in any command:
```bash
$B click @e3       $B fill @e4 "value"     $B hover @e1
$B html @e2        $B css @e5 "color"      $B attrs @e6
$B click @c1       # cursor-interactive ref (from -C)
```

**Output format:** indented accessibility tree with @ref IDs, one element per line.
```
  @e1 [heading] "Welcome" [level=1]
  @e2 [textbox] "Email"
  @e3 [button] "Submit"
```

Refs are invalidated on navigation — run `snapshot` again after `goto`.
